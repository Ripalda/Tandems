FUNCTION tandems.generate_spectral_bins(latMin=40 , latMax=40, longitude='random', AOD='random', PW='random', tracking=True, fname='Iscs')

    Generates a file with a complete set of binned averaged spectra for yearly energy yield calculations
    Location can be randomized within given lattitude limits: latMin, latMax.
    This might be useful to optimize cell designs to yield maximum energy for a range of lattitudes and atmospheric conditions, rather than at a single specific location.

    NECESARY CHANGES IN SMARTS 2.9.5 SOURCE CODE
    # Line 189
    #       batch = .TRUE.
    # Line 1514
    #      IF(Zenit.LE.75.5224)GOTO 13
    #      WRITE(16,103,iostat = Ierr24)Zenit
    # 103  FORMAT(//,'Zenit  =  ',F6.2,' is > 75.5224 deg. (90 in original code) This is equivalent to AM < 4'
    This change is needed because trackers are shadowed by neighboring trackers when the sun is near the horizon. 
    Zenit 80 is already too close to the horizon to use in most cases due to shadowing issues.

    .__init__( any of the input variables here )
        Use to change input parameters but keeping previously found set of optimal gap combinations.
        Call this to change input parameters without discarding previously found gaps before calling .recalculate()
        
    .intSpec(energy,spec)
         Returns integrated photocurrent from given photon energy to UV 
        
    .getIjx(spec)

    .serie(topJ,bottomJ)
         Get power from series connected subcells with indexes topJ to bottomJ. topJ = bottomJ is single junction. 
        
    .stack(spec)
         Use a single spectrum to get power from 4 terminal tandem. If topJunctions = junctions the result is for 2 terminal tandem.
