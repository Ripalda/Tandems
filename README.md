Calculate yearly average efficiencies for multijunction tandem solar cells

Random sampling of multijunction photovoltaic efficiencies. Jose M. Ripalda

Requires doing "pip install json_tricks" before running

Tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6

SMARTS 2.9.5 is required only to generate a new set of random spectra. 

File "lat40.npy" can be used instead of SMARTS to load a set of binned spectra.
